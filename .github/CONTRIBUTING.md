Thanks for taking a moment to drop by.

### Bug
If you noticed an issue in any of the code files (even this file), you can either create an issue, or fix the bug and submit a pull request.
Refer to [WIKI page](https://github.com/hedyhyry/c/wiki/Bugs-on-C-code) for more info.


### Cleaning Code
Of course there's lots of ways you can make the code simpler, so go ahead (if you can) make a commit and start a pull request. Again, you can refer to the [corresponding WIKI page](https://github.com/hedyhyry/c/wiki/Cleaning-code) for more info

### Adding comment guides
Here's an example:
```c
int counter; //creates a new variable
```
[Here](https://github.com/hedyhyry/c/wiki/Remarks-or-comments-on-the-code) is the wiki page for that.


### Submit a file
You are definitely welcomed to submit your own C files! If you don't see a "Create new file" button, please fork this repo, create a new file in your forked repo and then push your new file to this repo with a pull request.
