// game explanation (Work in progress): So there are 'n' monkeys,
// and they are tryin to figure out who is the king. They start by sitting in
// a circle and count 'm' to the right, the monkey that we're on will be 'out'.
// repeat the process until we're left with only one monkey. That monkey will
// be the king.
// this program outputs a log of who's out and the last one out is the king.
